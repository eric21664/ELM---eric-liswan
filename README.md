This image is actually WRONG! (oh my gosh, how dare I!) 

In order for the execs to actually SEE your code, you need to make it Public (just click the Public button! its easy!).

Now, click "Create repository".

Once you do that, you can go into the codespace. Click the green code button, and navigate to the "Codespaces" tab.

Click the plus icon to create your codespace.
